    "   Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your programme.\n",
    "    \n",
    ":- regular expressions, or regexes, is often used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax for representing patterns      for matching text, as distinct from the mathematical notation described below. Each character in a regular expression      (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a     regular character that has a literal meaning. When entering a regex in a programming language, they may be represented     as a usual string literal, hence usually quoted; this is common in C, Java, and Python for instance, where the regex re     is entered as \"re\". However, they are often written with slashes as delimiters, as in /re/ for the regex re. This           originates in ed, where / is the editor command for searching, and an expression /re/ can be used to specify a range of     lines (matching the pattern), which can be combined with other commands on either side, most famously g/re/p as in grep    (\"global regex print\"), which is included in most Unix-based operating systems, such as Linux distributions.
